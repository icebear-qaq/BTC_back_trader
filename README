# VWAP and EMA200 Trading Strategy with Backtrader

This project implements a trading strategy using the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) and the 200-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA200) with the Backtrader framework. The strategy is designed to buy when the price crosses above the VWAP and is above the EMA200, and to sell based on predefined take-profit and stop-loss thresholds.

## Installation
